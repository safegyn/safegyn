She has never asked me about whether my partner is there, what his view is, etc. She's written extensively about maternal choice and human rights in the context of deliveries, and we've discussed this extensively - so I would generally assume she's open, reasonable and forward-thinking. \n\nI am overweight and have PCOS, and have never been shamed. She did advise weight loss as a general strategy for well-being in an initial consultation, but has not mentioned it or 'needled' me or made me feel like a failure in subsequent follow ups. I found the discussion of the topic sensible - when I asked her for strategy, she advised seeking out a dietician.  \n\nPlease note that she does work within a Christian Missionary hospital and her views on some issues such as abortion may have to do with the place she works in and not her - I don't know as I have not discussed this, but I would advice anyone who is seeking her opinion to be conscious of this. A general note though - I found the patient group at the hospital I visited (CSI) diverse. There are women of all religions, classes and ages.

A lot of doctors who are allegedly open-minded are also quite bad at their jobs. This doctor will eventually try to fleece you and take you to join her private clinic for PCOS but until then she does a good job. She also is knowledgable about diet and about the woman's body. She is matter of fact about STDs and prescribes a single dose of antibiotics for it. She is good, not great but there is so much crap out there that she is much better than any other doctor I've seen.

He will deal with all variables of culture, background, religion with compassion, understanding, patience and the best medical advice.  His nursing home is always teeming with patients from various backgrounds. \n\nJoseph Nursing Home at first glance has none of that upscale, maternity hospital glam of let's say a Cloud9. But it has all the latest facilities and adopts the latest practices at a price that will pleasantly surprise you. At least, it surprised me, having shifted from the upmarket Cloud9 from Bangalore. \n\nAlso, I have heard of several instances when Dr Joseph has taken one's financial circumstances into the scheme of things and still afforded them the best care. \n\nAs far as pregnancy is concerned, he is one of those doctors who will attempt a normal delivery provided everything medically supports it. And only choose to do a C-section when it's an absolute must. He's one of the best surgeons around and my C-Section was a breeze, with minimal discomfort post surgery. Joseph Nursing Home is keyed to giving the best care to everyone and in that light you find many from lower middle class and poorer sections of society coming in. So a lot of their procedures, paper work is geared towards them. This might jar to a person from an upper middle class background like me. I took it for granted that the husband would be allowed in for scans. While the husband or any 1 single person is allowed into the delivery room (not applicable to C-Section delivery), the husband or other family members need to seek the Doc's permission to enter the scanning room. This is because they've had instances when the onlooker has insisted on being there in the hope of divining if it's boy or girl from just looking at the screen and tried to coerce the woman to abort. So, this is a preventive measure that I wasn't aware of, but which I initially mistook for prudishness. \n\nBut regardless of whether you're offended by what seems like old-world sensibilities, their procedures are geared towards solely giving the patient the best care.

A lot of doctors indulge in malpractices, even though they might eventually help you. Once they realize that the person is in a bothersome situation, there's nothing to stop them from taking you for a ride, but eventually they might help you. The problem with that isn't that their unnecessary tests are going to burden the person financially, it is that in such moments of stress and anxiety not knowing what will happen for quite some time only aggravates the suffering and anxiety of the individual.

She's extremely courteous and warm while remaining professional. On our first meeting she took down my case history meticulously, and communicated very clearly with me. She listened well and paid attention to all my symptoms, even those that weren't directly related to endometriosis, which is what I'd gone to her for. When it was time for our examination, she sought consent before she touched me. \n\nShe was extremely professional and absolutely non-judgmental about my sexuality, choices, and lifestyle. She recommended a USG at the clinic of an extremely respectful doctor. (Dr Jolly in GK1). She was happy to communicate over email and phone when the test results were not great and she told me how to make the next earliest possible appointment.\n\nWhen we met again, I was with a companion. Not only did she not question the fact that the companion was not a parent or spouse, she went so far as to make sure they were there with my explicit consent. At the end of the conversation, she waited for them to leave and kept me back in the chamber for a minute to ask me a question she thought should be absolutely private. I really, really appreciate this. \n\nShe went through my history properly and looked at my tests, and we discussed options. When she was writing my prescription she made sure she had my explicit consent on the pills she was writing down. She recommended more tests and explained why. She also brought up pregnancy/marriage plans but only in a medical sense. (Ignoring the marriage bit because I'm cutting her some slack considering the context she works in). It would be one course of treatment if I wanted to get pregnant and another if I did not. She brought up childlessness and adoption and affirmed that they were perfectly valid options she would fully respect, but if I did want to get pregnant, she said I was likelier to have fewer problems the earlier I started. \n\nBasically, she made sure I had all the info. and let me make my own decision. She respects the fact that I don't want to get pregnant and don't see myself wanting to in the future. ", "Will they keep your information private, even from your parents or partner?

Dr. Sikka made her feel very comfortable during the consultation, and I was impressed enough to go back to her myself and also recommended her to family members. From what I've experienced, her concern is solely regarding her patient's medical health -regarding pregnancy or contraception, she is not interested in your marital status and will not make you feel judged. \nWhen I was diagnosed with PCOD, I decided to try alternative therapy- homeopathy- and while Dr. Sikka preferred the line of biomedical treatment she suggested, she was open to me following homeopathic treatment, so that I could work with both doctors together. Dr. Sikka prescribed tests and ultrasounds and interpreted them regularly, and I took her feedback to my homeopath and eventually, I was PCOD free. I appreciated her openness to this. \nI have also once sent to Dr. Sikka a domestic staff person who worked in our home- this woman's young daughter was sexually molested and she wanted to make sure her daughter was infection-free. Dr. Sikka did not charge her for the consultation, even though I had sent the money for her fees. \nAt the time I started going to her, she charged Rs 300 when other doctors in private hospitals in South Delhi were not charging less than Rs 500. So she is definitely not money-minded. ", "Will they keep your information private, even from your parents or partner?

She was not fazed by our 'unmarried' status and asked relevant questions about our sexual activity, accepting the answers without censure. She was a comforting, positive and simultaneously no-nonsense presence both during the procedure and during a subsequent check-up. \nShe explained the procedure and the benefits of the hormonal IUD, without pushing us to take it - as we had previously decided on the copper IUD based on internet research. She was respectful of our choice, and her assurance made us rethink our decision and trust her judgement.\n\nThe other doctors in the clinic are slightly judgemental and one nurse proceeded to give us a lot of advice about 'settling-down' after taking a look at our files and seeing that we were 'unmarried' and had come in for a procedure that clearly indicated we were sexually active. However she was not overtly offensive, and given her life experience we could see where the lecture came from. She was also unintentionally racist to my friend - though again, in a well-intentioned way.\n\nDo call before you go in and ask specifically if Dr. Alexander will be available and if you can see her, for an unambiguously positive experience.

However, the gynaecologist told her that she can jolly well have an abortion, but as she is over 30 and she is also married, and without any children (And she does intend to have them), she should have the child, because, as she has a number of cysts in her ovary, her conception is somewhat a miracle, and she should strongly consider having the baby since it is actually for her benefit, since she did want a child. Following her advice, my friend had her baby, and refused to abort even though her husband pressurized her. Ratnaboli Chatterjee guided her through all the steps in pregnancy, told her specifically the dates when she should come for check ups, and gave her telephonic advice for smaller issues, without asking her to come in for a check up. In the end, she advocated against a natural childbirth after the last check up (my friend has issues with blood pressure and thyroid), and opted for a C-section, which saved her plenty of trauma and pain, and afterwards my friend recovered quite quickly, and now is quite happy. She was perfectly fine with her husband not joining her while she conducted check ups. ", "Will they keep your information private, even from your parents or partner?

I know several women who will agree with me. He never once questions a woman's right to request birth control (in any form). In fact, he will ensure that he studies the patient's requirements and charts properly to make sure she gets the best form suited to her physiology and needs.

She was always available over the phone and once opened her clinic early morning when I developed sudden back pain during the last leg of my pregnancy. She's a very careful doctor who does not take any chances. I went into labour on a Sunday but she still came to check on me after I'd been admitted in the hospital though I was in 'pre-labour' and nowhere close to delivery. She did her best to make a natural delivery possible but when the labour did not progress after many many hours of trying, she decided to do a C-sec after asking me if I was okay with it as well. She was very supportive after delivery as well. She ticked off the nurses who were bugging me to give my daughter formula and supported my decision to breastfeed whole-heartedly. She taught me how to do it as well. \n\nI'm immensely grateful to Dr.Gadhikar and I still can't talk about her without feeling a little sappy!
